For Better Health is a new organization and is recruiting members. I have been hired by this nonprofit organization that wants to help communities far from cities that need medical support.

## The Problem
What are some of the highest indicator that shows to have more possibilities of being at risk of having prediabetes or diabetes? Based on the highest indicators what can we in order to reduce the risk of having prediabetes or diabetes. Getting a solution will reduce not only the risk of having diabetes but also other health problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and other diseases associated with having diabetes.

## Data Source
- Diabetes Health Indicator Dataset from Kaggle
- It contains 70692 rows and 22 columns (features).
- It is a balanced dataset.
- Our target variable is the diabetes binary.
    Where :
